# Cloud Projects
This repository is a collection of cloud computing projects developed for the "Advanced Concepts of Cloud Computing" class. Each project is organized into its own folder within the repository.

## Projects

### Cloud_Database_Patterns
This project explores database scaling techniques and the implementation of cloud design patterns. It involves setting up a MySQL cluster on Amazon EC2 and deploying an architecture by adding the Proxy and the Gatekeeper patterns. The assignment includes installing, configuring, and benchmarking MySQL standalone server against the MySQL cluster. Additionally, it focuses on implementing and comparing cloud patterns in a distributed cluster environment.

Detailed instructions for running these specific assignment can be found in the README.md file located in the respective project folder.

### MapReduce_on_AWS
This project focuses on exploring MapReduce implementation on AWS and its practical applications. To achieve this, the following steps are taken:
- Execution of a simple wordcount problem on AWS, a classic example in MapReduce, to understand the MapReduce framework and its execution on AWS.
- Designing MapReduce operations to address business intelligence questions, particularly focusing on solving the friend recommendation problem. This exercise involves applying MapReduce skills to real-world scenarios and analyzing the results.

For detailed instructions on running the assignments, please refer to the accompanying PDF report located in the respective project folder.

### Cluster_Benchmarking
This project focuses on benchmarking clusters using EC2 Virtual Machines and Elastic Load Balancer. To accomplish this, the following tasks are undertaken:
- Setting up a cluster environment using EC2 Virtual Machines to create a distributed computing system.
- Utilizing Elastic Load Balancer to distribute incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances, ensuring scalability and fault tolerance.
- Performing benchmark tests on the cluster to evaluate its performance under various workloads and conditions.
