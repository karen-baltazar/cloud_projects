# Scaling Databases and Implementing Cloud Design Patterns
## 1. Benchmarking MySQL stand-alone vs. MySQL Cluster

To conduct benchmarking after executing `scripts.sh`, follow these steps:

### Stand-alone Environment:
1. Connect to the stand-alone instance via SSH.
2. Execute `mysql_stand_alone.sh` on the corresponding instance.
3. Run `benchmark.sh` to perform performance tests and save the results to `/home/ubuntu/results.txt`.
4. To view the results, navigate to the `/home/ubuntu/` directory and open the file using a text editor such as `nano` or `cat`.

### Cluster Environment:
1. Connect to the master node instance via SSH.
2. Execute `master_setup.sh` on the master node.
3. Connect to each slave node via SSH and run `slave_setup.sh`.
4. Reconnect to the master node and run `benchmark.sh` to perform performance tests. The results will be saved in `/home/ubuntu/results.txt`.
5. To view the results, navigate to the `/home/ubuntu/` directory and open the file using a text editor such as `nano` or `cat`.

## 2. Cloud Patterns Execution

Make sure you have completed the cluster configuration before running the Cloud Patterns.

### 2.1 Proxy Execution

1. Connect via SSH to the proxy instance.
2. Run the following commands to install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y python3
    pip3 install mysql-connector-python
    pip3 install ping3
    ```
3. Run the proxy Python file:
    ```bash
    python3 proxy_setup.py
    ```

### 2.2 Trusted Host Execution

1. Connect via SSH to the trusted host instance.
2. Run the following commands to update the system and install Python:
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install -y python3
    ```
3. Run the trusted host Python file:
    ```bash
    python3 trusted_host_setup.py
    ```

### 2.3 Gatekeeper Execution

1. Connect via SSH to the gatekeeper instance.
2. Run the following commands to update the system and install Python:
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install -y python3
    ```
3. Run the gatekeeper Python file:
    ```bash
    python3 gatekeeper_setup.py "<query>"
    ```
   
Note: Replace `"<query>"` with the SQL query you want to execute on the Sakila database.

For more information, see the attached report in the repository.
